Masters thesis research conducted as a part of the Computational Astrophysics Group at Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich

- Implemented and tested the unequal mass dark matter self-interaction module for numerical simulations in the cosmological N-body/SPH simulation code OpenGadget3.
- Simulated isolated dark matter halos and compared the variation of central densities in CDM and SIDM simulations.
- Identifying the dependence of observed high central densities on the mass ratio of simulated two DM species and the composition of the halo.
