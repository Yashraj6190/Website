Reserach conducted as part of the Computational Astrophysics group at the Ludwig Maximilian University.

- Employed numerical simulations to study the scenario of a galaxy falling into a cluster in OpenGadget3
- Analyzed the effect of SIDM causing galactic disk distortion as it moves through the cluster
- Quantifying the disk's S and U-shaped warps along with the thickness for different cross-section of self-interaction and different concentration of galactic DM halo scenarios
